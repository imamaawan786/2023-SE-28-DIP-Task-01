Task 1
Using Python along with OpenCV and Matplotlib, develop a program that loads a colored image from a specified file location and verifies whether the image has been read correctly. Convert the image from BGR color space to RGB for proper visualization. Separate the image into its individual Red, Green, and Blue channels. Then convert the image into grayscale and apply thresholding to create a binary image. Display the original image, RGB channels, grayscale image, and binary image using Matplotlib subplots.
